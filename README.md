# Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework to give generative models knowledge without finetuning themselves. In this way, an LLM can adapt to new tasks quickly with the presence of new documents.

# Features

Langchain Pipeline: Utilizes cutting-edge language processing models to analyze, generate, and manipulate text data.

Pinecone Vector Database: Efficiently handles high-dimensional vector data, enabling fast and scalable similarity search.

Gradio Interface: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to interact with the application, input data, and visualize results.

# Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or higher

Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
